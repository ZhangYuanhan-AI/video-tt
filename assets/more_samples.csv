./assets/samples/LUxtvSdp8OI.mp4,Event Speed,Movement Speed,How does the speed of the orange watering can change?,"The speed of the orange watering can slows down over time. At first, when the person pushes the spray can out and then starts demonstrating spinning the stick, the watering can swings in a big motion. However, all objects in pendulum motion will eventually stop due to resistant forces like air resistance in real life. While the person in the foreground gradually speeds up their demonstration as the video progresses, the watering can in the background moves slower and slower until it is about to stop at the end of the video. The speed of the orange watering can does not increase over time. The video begins with the man pushing the spray can out, then no more interaction is conducted. As the demonstration progresses, the speed of the spinning stick held by the man gets faster and faster due to the applied force from the man, and the spray can moves slower and slower until it is about to stop since it is left alone."

./assets/samples/KSQhQFVQj5M.mp4,Plot Attributes (Narrative Editing),Narrative Editing,What narrative purpose does the scene with the person drinking from a cup serve in the video?,"The scene with the person drinking from a cup serves to illustrate the financial impact of damaging a rented house. The video starts with a person testing the performance of each bat by hitting baseballs, but the player is hitting each baseball towards the building in the background. The scene then transitions to a person in a room, possibly an apartment. Based on the narration, this is meant to indicate the person is living in the building which the first person is hitting the baseballs towards, and the baseballs possibly broke past the windows or walls of the apartment, hitting the cabinets and breaking big holes in them. The text overlay shows the initial deposit amount and then the deductions made for each broken piece in the house, providing a visual representation of the decreasing balance. Thus, it can be inferred that the person does not actually own this house but rented it, and the physical damage caused by the person playing baseball outside is actually causing financial damages to the man drinking."
./assets/samples/nkY5znKeKzE.mp4,Plot Attributes (Narrative Editing),Narrative Editing,What is the main interaction between the combined shots?,"The main interaction between the combined shots is the kicking back and forth of an empty water bottle between the man in the grass field scene and a woman in a gym. The sequence is cleverly edited so that the woman kicks the bottle to the left side of the screen while the bottle is received from the right side of the screen by the man on the grassy field. This sequence continues with the man throwing the bottle back to the right side of the screen, and the back and forth exchange continues multiple times with acrobatic moves, precision, and coordination until it ends up hitting a young boy on the field in the end. This exchange of kicking the water bottle is not done physically but rather a clever combination of montage to make it believable."
./assets/samples/WbCqk3TIySs.mp4,Plot Attributes (Narrative Editing),Narrative Editing,"Based on the narrative in the video, why did a piece of meat appear on the grill?","Based on the narrative in the video, the piece of meat appeared on the second chef's grill because the first chef, who was cutting the meat in a hot air balloon, cut and dropped it from the high air, which then landed on the second chef's grill when he turned his back against the grill. Then when he turned back, he observed with shock and looked up into the sky, trying to comprehend the sudden appearance of a slice of meat not prepared by him. This is a clever combination of two shots to make a comedic effect, as in a true physical sense this would be unlikely to happen."
./assets/samples/fCm_r8_aCio.mp4,Plot Attributes (Narrative Editing),Narrative Editing,What is the narrative purpose of the shot with the microscope?,"The shot with the microscope serves to reveal why the man was crying, as a narrative tool. At the beginning of the video, a man is crying and collecting his tears to place under a microscope, followed by memory scenes appearing. Since the function of a microscope is to examine what is contained within a substance, it can be inferred narratively that placing the tears under the microscope is to investigate the reason behind the man's tears."
./assets/samples/OzEatPGBoe0.mp4,Objective Causality,Unclear & Unusual,Why can't the man pour ketchup out at his second try?,"The man cannot pour ketchup out on his second try because the mouth of the bottle is facing upward. In the video, it can be seen that during the first try, the person forgot to remove the cap from the bottle. He then turns the mouth of the bottle upward to open the cap, but when he tries to pour again, he forgets to turn the mouth of the bottle downwards, thus he couldn't pour the ketchup out."

At this point, the photographer captures a photo. Next, in the same location, the protagonist removes the wings and recreates the same pose. The photographer takes another photo. Finally, the two photos are edited together to produce the completed image."
./assets/samples/9nRFVqAwfjE.mp4,Objective Causality (Technical Editing),Technical Editing,How are the ripples of the shark jumping in the video created?,"The ripples of the shark jumping in the video are created by a small object, possibly a pebble, being dropped into the water. The people in the video are shown filming the preproduction of the rippling scene first, and it later underwent post-editing. The shark is an animated overlay added during video editing to create the illusion of a shark jumping and causing the ripples."
./assets/samples/vSkT8O8dvJ0.mp4,Objective Causality (Technical Editing),Technical Editing,Why is the posture of the person wearing a black shirt different to his shadow in the final photo?,"The posture of the person wearing a black shirt is different from his shadow in the final photo because of the use of digital photo compositing technology to combine two photos into one. It makes the posture of the arms held on the poles appear in the shadow, while the arms of the real body are by their sides. The photographer first took a photo of the person's shadow, where the person's arms were bent out and holding onto two poles out of six. Before the second photo was taken, the person being photographed then removed the poles and turned around, with his arms resting by his sides and not holding anything. The photographer then took photo in this body posture without the poles. Finally, the two photos were combined to create this photo effect."
./assets/samples/9-s86F6vk2Y.mp4,Objective Causality (Technical Editing),Technical Editing,How is the person standing on the guitar in the photo at the end?,"The person appears to be standing on the guitar due to a clever photographic perspective.

This process helps to ensure a clean break and smooth edge on the glass."
./assets/samples/2JHsowO3o2E.mp4,Professional Knowledge,World Knowledge,How does the woman in red keep the apple from falling?,"The woman keeps the apple from falling by using a piece of paper that is folded multiple times to increase its strength. This folded paper is placed between two boxes, creating a bridge that can support the weight of the apple. The increased thickness and rigidity of the folded paper prevent it from bending or collapsing under the apple's weight."
./assets/samples/SHiZrwSPVrg.mp4,Professional Knowledge,World Knowledge,What is the function of two cups with red liquid?,"The two cups with red liquid are used to add weights and keep balance in the science experiment to demonstrate that a large weight can be lifted after creating a vacuum. The process involves lighting a candle placed between the two cups and then covering the candle with a glass. As the candle burns, it consumes oxygen, and once the oxygen is depleted, the flame goes out, creating a vacuum inside the glass. This vacuum causes the glass to firmly stick to the surface beneath the candle. Eventually, the glass is stuck in place enough that lifting it can lift the platform with the two cups of weights from the liquid."
./assets/samples/bWl5aFDT7pQ.mp4,Professional Knowledge,World Knowledge,"In the physical experiment in the video, why is the match successfully lit in the end?","The match is successfully lit in the end because it is dried completely after soaking in water.

Why did she do it?,"The girl is in annoyance or irritation with her boyfriend because the gift from the boy is actually not a gold ring but a chocolate wrapper. The boy surprised the girl with a ring placed on his phone. Initially, it looks like a digital photo, but when the screen turns black, it looks real. Then the girl takes the gold ring from the phone and holds it with her fingers to look carefully, only to realize it is actually a chocolate wrapper as it is very soft and easily bendable, and the boy's teeth have lingering brownish content as a sign that he just ate the chocolate. Then the woman is annoyed and angered by the man and kicks him away as a response."
